            <h3>Jonathon Beck</h3>
            <p>This is my 6th quarter now (Winter 2026) and I am currently pursuing my 
                <strong>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</strong>.
                I was a Signal Support Systems Specialist (25U) in the U.S. Army. If it sent a signal, received a signal, or plugged into something, 
                I was generally the one they called for help.</p>
